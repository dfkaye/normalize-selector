[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfkaye/normalize-selector.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dfkaye/normalize-selector)

# normalize-selector

bullpen for testing [Kyle Simpson](//github.com/getify)'s `normalizeSelector()` 
method from https://gist.github.com/getify/9679380

# rawgithub

view the browser suite directly on 
[rawgithub](https://rawgithub.com/dfkaye/normalize-selector/master/test/mocha/browser-suite.html)

# tests

run mocha tests on node.js with 

    npm test
    
or

    node ./test/mocha/node-suite.js

If you're using testem

    npm run testem
    
# cases

"some" cases taken from CSS [OPEN WEB REFERENCE](http://ref.openweb.io/CSS/)

# tdd-boilerplate

project is built following my 
[tdd-boilerplate](https://github.com/dfkaye/tdd-boilerplate), with testem, npm 
scripts, travis, rawgithub, and mocha (node and browser tests).  that's probably 
overkill...
